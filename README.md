# Groceries Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering

## Overview
Product recommendation can encourage purchase by recommending products customers might not have previously considered, resulting in increase in sales for the company.
The objective of this project is to provide personalised product recommendations to customers based on their historical transactions using User-Based Collaborative Filtering, Item-Based Collaborative Filtering and Singular Value Decomposition.
An analysis will also be performed to compare the results and performance across these methods.
